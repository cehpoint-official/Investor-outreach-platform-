You are designing an AI-powered Investor-Startup Deal Room with an advanced email communication workflow similar to AY Ventures’ deal portal, enhanced with AI using Google Gemini and Firebase as the backend infrastructure.

Goal:
Replicate AY Ventures’ email system with added AI-powered automation, personalization, and engagement tracking.

Current Tech Stack:
- Firebase for authentication, Firestore for database, Firebase Storage for file hosting.
- Google Gemini for AI (email drafting, tone enhancement, smart triggers).
- Current email sending uses AWS SES → Replace with:
  - **SendGrid API** or **SMTP via NodeMailer** integrated with Firebase Cloud Functions.

New Requirements:

1. **Intelligent Matching & Send-Guard**
   - Match investors based on sector, stage, cheque size using Firestore queries.
   - Restrict email sending only to matched investors and display reason in UI.

2. **One-to-One Email from Deal Room**
   - Allow founders to send personalized emails from investor profile view inside deal room.
   - Gemini API for tone enhancement (Professional, Persuasive, Friendly).

3. **Investor-Initiated Messaging**
   - Enable investors to message or email founders directly from the deal room.
   - Gemini generates polite and contextual responses for investors.

4. **AI Reply Assistant**
   - For every incoming email or message, Gemini drafts a contextual reply.
   - Options: Short, Detailed, Formal, Casual.

5. **Multi-Step Follow-up Automation**
   - Build an email sequence system in Firebase Functions:
     - Intro email
     - Follow-up after X days if no reply
     - Trigger if pitch viewed but no response
   - Allow customization in Firestore with AI-enhanced templates.

6. **Email Template Library**
   - Pre-built Gemini-enhanced templates for:
     - Initial Outreach
     - Follow-up
     - Thank You
     - Investor Update

7. **Attachment & Link Tracking**
   - Store pitch decks in Firebase Storage.
   - Generate secure shareable links with tracking IDs (Firestore to log opens/downloads).

8. **Engagement Tracking in Deal Room**
   - Track email opens using pixel + link clicks (store in Firestore).
   - Show per investor:
     - Last email sent
     - Opened, Clicked, Replied status
     - Deck viewed/downloaded
   - Display timeline on investor profile page.

9. **AI Subject Line Optimizer**
   - Use Gemini to generate multiple subject line variations with predicted engagement scores.

10. **Weekly Progress Email to Founder**
    - Firebase Scheduled Functions send summary:
      - Emails sent, Opens, Replies, Deck Views.

11. **Investor Segmentation & Scoring**
    - AI ranks investors based on:
      - Email engagement
      - Profile match score
    - Display priority list inside deal room.

12. **AI-Driven Smart Triggers**
    - If investor opened but didn’t reply → auto-follow-up after X days.
    - If clicked but no download → send reminder email.
    - Implement in Firebase Cloud Functions using Firestore triggers.

13. **Conversation Timeline**
    - Store all email/message threads in Firestore.
    - Show complete conversation timeline inside deal room UI.
    - Add notes feature for founders.

14. **Compliance & Spam Protection**
    - Ensure sender domain verified with SPF/DKIM (for SendGrid or SMTP).
    - Include unsubscribe link for bulk campaigns.

15. **Optional Approval Workflow**
    - Before sending, AI reviews the email (Gemini suggestions).
    - Allow manual approval or AI-enhanced auto-approval.

Technical Notes:
- **Email Delivery**:
  - Use SendGrid API or SMTP (NodeMailer) via Firebase Cloud Functions.
- **AI**:
  - Use Gemini models for:
    - Email drafting
    - Tone adjustment
    - Follow-up and response suggestions
    - Subject line optimization
- **Engagement Tracking**:
  - Use tracking pixel and unique link IDs (store events in Firestore).
  - Show analytics in dashboard.

Output Required:
- Feature flow diagram (Investor ↔ Founder ↔ AI ↔ Firebase interactions).
- UI components list (buttons, dashboards, engagement panels).
- Backend architecture outline for:
    - Email sending via Firebase Functions
    - AI integration with Gemini
    - Engagement tracking system
- API design for:
    - Match investors (Firestore query)
    - Generate AI templates (Gemini API)
    - Send email & log engagement and AI-Powered Investor Deal Room & Campaign Generator - System Overview
